    "holds for all $v\\in V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few facts, that will let us easily compute Jacobians (and therefore gradients and Hessians):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear functions**: \n",
    "If $f:V\\to W$ is a linear map, then we have \n",
    "$$({\\rm d}_x f(x)) v = f(v),$$\n",
    "i.e. the differential of a linear map is the map itself.  \n",
    "E.g. matrix transposition is a linear map $\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}\\to \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$ and hence $({\\rm d}_x x^T)v = v^T$. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "If $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ is an affine linear map, i.e. $f(x)=Ax+b$ for a $m\\times n$-matrix $A$ and a vector $b\\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, then the Jacobian of $f$ is $A$:\n",
    "$${\\rm d}_x(Ax+b) =A$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bilinear functions**: For a bilinear map $B:U\\times V\\to W, (x,y)\\mapsto B(x,y)$ and any tangent vector $(u,v)$ at $(x,y)$ we have: \n",
    "$$\\left({\\rm d}_{(x,y)}(B(x,y)\\right)(u,v) = B(u,y)+B(x,v)$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chain rule**: \n",
    "${\\rm d}_x (f\\circ g) = ({\\rm d}_{g(x)}f) \\circ ({\\rm d}_{x}g)$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Product rule**: matrix multiplication is a bilinear map. Therefore by combining 2. and 3. we get for functions $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to \\mathbb{R}^{a\\times b}, g: \\mathbb{R}^n\n",
    "\\to \\mathbb{R}^{b\\times c}$ and a tangent vector $v\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$:\n",
    "$${\\rm d}_x(f(x)\\cdot g(x))v = ({\\rm d}_x f(x) v)\\cdot g(x) + f(x) \\cdot ({\\rm d}_x g(x) v) $$\n",
    "Compare this with the well-known onedimensional formula \n",
    "$$(f(x)g(x))' = f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules suffice to compute differentials, gradients and Hessians of many functions without ever having to get into an \"index battle\" by looking at the components $A_{ij}$ of a matrix $A$ etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example let us derive the formula for the gradient of the function $A\\mapsto \\operatorname{tr} AB$, where $A,B$ are suitable matrices (this formula was presented in class at the end of lecture 2). Clearly this is a linear map. <br>\n",
    "The standard inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ is given by $\\langle x,y\\rangle := \\operatorname{tr} x^Ty$ (check that this is indeed an inner product and that for $m=1$ we recover the canonical inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^m = \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times 1}$).  \n",
    "Therefore for any tangent vector (tangent matrix?) $v$ ($v$ is a matrix of the same shape as $A$) we get\n",
    "$$ {\\rm d}_A(\\operatorname{tr} AB)v = \\operatorname{tr} vB = \\operatorname{tr} Bv = \\langle B^T,v\\rangle,$$\n",
    "i.e. $\\nabla_A(\\operatorname{tr} AB) = B^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture we were also presented with a formula for the gradient of $A\\mapsto \\operatorname{tr} AA^TC$. Using rules 2 and 3 above this can be done as follows (we use that $\\operatorname{tr} X^T = \\operatorname{tr} X$ and $\\operatorname{tr} XY = \\operatorname{tr} YX$):\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "{\\rm d}_A(\\operatorname{tr} AA^TC) v &= {\\rm d}_A \\langle A^T, A^TC\\rangle v \\\\\n",
    "&= \\langle v^T, A^TC\\rangle + \\langle A^T, v^TC\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "& = \\operatorname{tr} vA^TC + \\operatorname{tr} Av^TC\\\\\n",
    "&= \\operatorname{tr} A^TCv +\\operatorname{tr} v^TCA\\\\\n",
    "&= \\operatorname{tr} A^TCv +\\operatorname{tr} A^TC^Tv\\\\\n",

    "$${\\rm d}_x\\left(\\frac {1}{2} x^TAx+b^Tx\\right)v =\\frac {1}{2}( v^TAx + x^TAv) + b^Tv.$$\n",

    "This proves ${\\rm d}_x (f(x))= x^TA+ b^T$. Taking the transpose we get the gradient:\n",
