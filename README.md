# CS229: Machine Learning

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets of the 2018 Stanford course CS229 by Andrew Ng.

I organized the solutions in IPython notebooks that can be read online in github. For better readability you can also view the notebooks in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Joker14641/cs229/tree/master/).
