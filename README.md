# CS229: Machine Learning

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets of the 2018 Stanford course CS229 by Andrew Ng.

I organized the solutions in IPython notebooks that can be read online in github. For better readability you can also view the notebooks in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Joker14641/cs229/tree/master/).

## Course material

## Problem sets and solutions

- [Problem set 0: Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus](https://github.com/Joker14641/cs229/blob/master/Problem%20Sets/Problem%20Set%200/ps0.pdf)
  - [Solutions](https://github.com/Joker14641/cs229/blob/master/Problem%20Sets/Problem%20Set%200/solutions0.ipynb) Please note that I added a small aside on differentials and Jacobians, which I will consistently use throughout the problem sets though they haven't been covered in the lectures.
